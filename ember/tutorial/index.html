                    Building an App with Ember
                </h1>
                <p>
                    This tutorial will walk you through the steps necessary to build a small web-based application using <a href="http://www.emberjs.com/">Ember JS</a>. The
                    latest version at the time of this writing was 2.1.0, and has been used to detail the following steps. Please note, Ember changes VERY frequently, so stick
                    with the version used here to ensure maximum compatibility.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="well">
                <h3>The Notes App</h3>
                <p>
                    The site we’re building here is a simple note-taking site, where you can create and view notes you wish to save for later.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="page-header">
                <h3 id="GettingReady">Getting Things Ready</h3>
            </div>

            <p>
                The first step is to get all of the backend setup and running. The site uses a REST-based API to communicate new notes, and retrieve notes already created.
                This backend service uses Restify for the API and a SQLite database for persistence.

                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <div class="page-header">
                <h3 id="CreatingApp">Creating a New Ember App</h3>
            </div>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <pre class="language-bash"><code>ember new notesApp</code></pre>

                    Navigate to <a href="http://localhost:4200/">http://localhost:4200</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To see what the test output looks like:
                    <a href="http://localhost:4200/tests">http://localhost:4200/tests</a>
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>
                <i>"Welcome to Ember"</i>? Where did that come from…
            </p>
            <p>
                If you look at the project structure, nothing in index seems to tell us where that content came from, but if you examine the file
                “notesApp/app/templates/application.hbs”, you can see the welcome message is a part of the application template, which was given automatically to render an index (root)
                view.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ember generator provides a ton of blueprints you can use to make file management easier for you. Just tell the cli that you need a controller named
                “index”, and it’ll make sure it’s in the right place and importing/exporting the right things.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ember is an MVC framework, so it works with models as representations of underlying data, controllers to handle actions taken on that data, and views to
                allow the data to be displayed and modified. The models are made simpler to work with thanks to the Ember Data library, and views are realized through
                simple HTML markup and Handlebars data binding.
            </p>

            <div class="page-header">
                <h3 id="FirstModel">Creating the First Model</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                To generate the concept of an object with its dedicated route/model/template implementation, enter the following at the command line:
            </p>
            <pre class="language-bash"><code>
ember generate resource note
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                This generate command tells Ember CLI that we want to represent an object in our application called “note”. The CLI makes our lives easier by creating and
                placing all of the files we need in order to do this, and in the proper locations. If you navigate to the app/models folder, you’ll see a note.js file has
                been generated. Opening the file, you’ll see that all it does is import Ember Data and export a subclass of the Model class. Let’s add the properties of
                the note object we want to store. Add the following to your note.js.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
import DS from 'ember-data';
export default DS.Model.extend({
    title: DS.attr('string'),
    body: DS.attr('string'),
    created: DS.attr('date', {
        defaultValue() { return new Date(); }
    }),
    keywords: DS.attr('string')
});
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                As you can see, the code is fairly self-explanatory. we provide the properties as with any other JS object, but we set them to the result of
                callingDS.attr(), specifying the type we’re dealing with. The keywords property is an array, so we don’t specify a type. The only property that’s a little
                different is the created date. We’re passing in an object as the second parameter to the attr function so that we can tell it to return a new Date instance
                as the default value. This could be done with any of the peroperties, if we wanted to, but we actually need it here to ensure a new note always has the
                current date attached to the created property.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that the model is done, we can turn our attention to the second file added by the generator: app/routes/note.js. Routes in Ember are objects that tell
                the app what to do when a specific area of the app is triggered. We can utilize it here to return some data we can use for testing that this thing is
                actually working. Add the following code.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({
    model() {
        return { title: "Hello world" };
    }
});
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                The last file created with the generate command is the view, or Handlebars template for a note in our app, which exists under app/templates/note.js. Let’s
                see if we can see the data from our test note being returned in the route. Remove the {{outlet}} from the file and replace it with {{model.title}}.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
{{model.title}}
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                The last piece required is a change to the app’s app/router.js. This file tells the application to direct requests to certain paths to corresponding routes in
                our routes directory. We’re going to tell ember we want the root of the application to invoke the note route we just setup.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
import Ember from 'ember';
import config from'./config/environment';

var Router = Ember.Router.extend({
    location: config.locationType
});

Router.map(function() {
    this.route('note', { path: '/' });
});

export default Router;
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                Now if you flip back to your browser, you can see the changes have taken effect, and the page should now look like this.
            </p>
            <div class="screencap">
                <img class="img-responsive" src="images/note-test-view.png" alt="Testing our route"/>
            </div>
            <p>
                Wait, we didn’t hit refresh, did we? Well, we didn’t have to. Thanks to the ember serve command we used earlier, ember has been watching our app’s files
                for changes, and refreshing the screen when needed. Cool, right? There are, of course, some occasions where you will need to restart the server by using
                Ctrl+C to stop it, then starting it again with the ember serve command.
            </p>

            <div id="BootstrapIt" class="page-header">
                <h3>Bootstrap It</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                We can see data on the screen, but the styling is non-existent, so it looks like crap. Let’s incorporate Bootstrap and create an application style and layout that isn’t
                very difficult to implement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Start by running the following command from the notesApp folder.
            </p>
            <pre class="language-bash"><code>
bower install bootstrap –-save-dev
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                While we’re at it, let’s add the moment library too, because we know we’re going to need it:
            </p>
            <pre class="language-bash"><code>
bower install moment –-save-dev
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                Once these have been installed, we have to tell Ember where to find them so that they can be included as a part of the content required by the app. We do
                this by adding app.import() calls to the ember-cli-build.js under the notesApp directory.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
/* global require, module */
var EmberApp = require('ember-cli/lib/broccoli/ember-app');

module.exports = function(defaults) {
  var app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
    // Add options here
  });

  // Use `app.import` to add additional libraries to the generated
  // output files.
  //
  // If you need to use different assets in different
  // environments, specify an object as the first parameter. That
  // object's keys should be the environment name and the values
  // should be the asset to use in that environment.
  //
  // If the library that you are including contains AMD or ES6
  // modules that you would like to import into your application
  // please specify an object with the list of modules as keys
  // along with the exports of each module as its value.
  app.import(app.bowerDirectory + '/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css');
  app.import(app.bowerDirectory + '/moment/min/moment.min.js');

  return app.toTree();
};
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                Now you will need to restart your server in order to see if everything works again as expected.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let’s switch the typical CSS out for SASS, so we can avoid repeating ourselves too much in the styling. This is really easy with Ember, as all we need to
                do is run the following command from the notesApp directory:
            </p>
            <pre class="language-bash"><code>
npm install ember-cli-sass -–save-dev
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                Then, just rename the app.css file in notesApp/styles to app.scss. That’s it, now we can use SASS in place of CSS and Ember will handle the rest of the
                work for us. You should probably restart your ember serve command at this point as well. Anytime you add a new Node module, it’s a safe bet a restart will
                be required.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now we need to utilize the new Bootstrap styling to make our app look a little better. Open the app/templates/application.hbs file and change it to use a
                new layout.
            </p>
            <pre class="language-markup"><code>
&lt;nav class=&quot;navbar navbar-default navbar-fixed-top&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;container-fluid&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;navbar-header&quot;&gt;
        &lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; class=&quot;navbar-toggle collapsed&quot; 
                data-toggle=&quot;collapsed&quot; data-target=&quot;#bs-example-navbar-collapse-1&quot;&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;sr-only&quot;&gt;Toggle Navigation&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;icon-bar&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;icon-bar&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;icon-bar&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;a class=&quot;navbar-brand&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;
{{outlet}}
&lt;/div&gt;
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                If all goes well, you should see something in your browser that looks like this:
            </p>
            <div class="screencap">
                <img class="img-responsive" src="images/index-after-adding-bootstrap.png"/>
            </div>
            <p>
                Throw the following style into your app.scss under app/styles to make sure our page content has some room and any navigation items added in the future show
                as highlighted.
            </p>
            <pre class="language-css"><code>
body {
    padding-top: 75px;
}

nav .active {
    font-weight: bold;
}
            </code></pre>

            <div class="page-header">
                <h3 id="ShowingList">Showing a List</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                Now that we’ve seen the basics and the app has some styling, we need the root of our application to always show all of the current notes when the user
                visits the site. In order to do this, we will need the important parts of a successful navigation in Ember: the Route, Model and View.
            </p>
            <p>
                Start by changing the router.js to take us to a route for “notes” when the root path is requested.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
import Ember from 'ember';
import config from './config/environment';

var Router = Ember.Router.extend({
   location: config.locationType 
});

Router.map(function() {
   this.route('notes', { path: '/' });
});

export default Router;
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                Since we’re telling the root path to use the “notes” route, we need to create it. Add a new file called notes.js to the app/routes folder, 
                or use the following CLI command:
            </p>
            <pre class="language-bash"><code>
 ember generate route notes
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                 The content of this file should look like this for now:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({
   model: function() {
        return this.store.find('note');

            <p>
                This begs a good question: why run the command from the CLI if all you have to do is add one file? Well, the CLI does more than that. If you run the
                generate route command for this case, you’ll see that not only did it create the one file, it also created a template that matched it for your view, as
                well as a unit test file for the notes route. It also would have added it to the router.js, but it skips that here because it can see we’ve already added
                it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wondering what the this.store.find() thing is all about? Well, this is another awesome feature to dig into. Ember has the concept of adapters, which are
                really objects that your code can use to work with a given data source. We will be using a REST adapter, which is designed to communicate via AJAX calls to
                the backend API for your application. Let’s go ahead and get our adapter setup now.
            </p>
            
            <div class="page-header">
                <h3 id="SettingUpAdapter">Setting up an Adapter</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                Run the generate command to create your adapter file:
            </p>
            <pre class="language-bash"><code>
ember generate adapter application
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                This creates the file app/adaters/application.js, which tells our app how to communicate with our REST service. The details of what’s in this file are a
                little deep to get into here, but suffice to say it’s making our app communicate effectively with our REST endpoint. Make sure yours looks like this.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.RESTAdapter.reopen({
    host: 'http://localhost:8080',
    namespace: 'api',
    ajax: function(url, method, hash) {
        hash = hash || {}; // hash may be undefined
        hash.crossDomain = true;
        return this._super(url, method, hash);
    },
    deleteRecord: function() {
        var response = this._super.apply(this, arguments);
        return response.then(function(/*response*/) {
            // This is a workaround for an ember RESTAdapter delete call issue
            return null;
        });
    }
});

            <p>
                The cool thing about Ember’s adapters is that there are a bunch of them that you can use right out of the box. There’s one for storing your data in memory
                (gone when the page is refreshed), local storage, various types of database servers, etc. 
                Check out the <a href="https://guides.emberjs.com/v1.10.0/models/customizing-adapters/">adapter specifics</a> to learn more.

                As you can see, we’re using handlebars syntax (the “{{“ and “}}”) to insert data from our notes into the rendered markup. Using the #each helper allows us
                to write the markup for each of the notes in our model. Let’s add the remaining styling to our app/styles/app.scss now so it’s all ready to go.

            <p>
                Now if you look at the browser again, you see a scattering of panels each holding information about a note that exists in the REST service’s data store.
                Ember needed just the application adapter we created and the this.store.find(‘note’) call in the notes route in order to bring the data back from the
                server. Ember is smart enough to be able to figure out how it should structure request URL’s so that it can accomplish the various things we ask it to do
                using the store object in our routes. For instance, because we said store.find(‘note’), it assumed we wanted to execute an HTTP GET to the host in our
                application adapter, appending ‘/notes’ to the URL, which is exactly where the web API was watching for calls to send back all the notes in the data store.
                Pretty slick, huh?
            </p>
            <p>
                Your browser should now look like this, which has some issues we need to address next:
            </p>
            <div class="screencap">
                <img class="img-responsive" src="images/notes-list-rendered-for-the-first-time.png" alt="Our first rendering of the notes list."/>
            </div>

            <div class="page-header">
                <h3 id="FirstHelper">Building your First Helper</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                The worst thing here is the JavaScript date format we’re seeing on the notes. Let’s clean that up using the best tool for the job: moment.js. We added that
                dependency through bower back at the beginning of this tutorial, so it’s ready to be used by our code. In Ember, creating a block of code that helps us
                display something more effectively in the view is a job typically performed by an Ember object called a helper. 
                We will create a helper file in the app/helpers folder named “from-now-date.js”, which should include the following code:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Handlebars.makeBoundHelper(function(date) {
    return moment(date).fromNow();
});
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                We’re utilizing moment here to get an easy-to-read version of when the note was created. 
                To make use of this new helper, add the from-now-date call into
                your notes.hbs template right before the note.created date reference, as below:
            </p>
            <pre class="language-markup"><code>
&lt;small class="muted blockLink"&gt;
    {{from-now-date note.created}}
&lt;/small&gt;
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                Another issue we will encounter is ensuring that the entire content of a long note isn’t rendered into this “card” view, as there’s just not enough room.
                We really want to just show a preview of the note, so let’s add a helper that can ensure we only grab a portion of the note’s body. Add the file
                “format-note-preview.js” to your helpers folder right next to the helper we just created. We’ll add some code to this file to limit the amount of text
                rendered from the body of the note to 50 characters or less using the following:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Handlebars.makeBoundHelper(function(note) {
    return note.length > 50 ? note.substring(0, 50) + '...' : note;
});
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                We will use this helper where we render out the note.body property in our notes.hbs file:
            </p>
            <pre class="language-markup"><code>
&lt;div class="panel-body"&gt;
    {{format-note-preview note.body}}
&lt;/div&gt;
            </code></pre>

            <div class="page-header">
                <h3 id="Linking">Linking in Ember</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                Now that we can see our notes, we need a way to select one and view its details. This is where routing and routes come back into play, as we’re moving from
                one view to another within our SPA (Single Page App). Let’s start by creating the anchor tags in our view that will navigate to the details for a given
                task, using the link-to helper provided for us by Ember. This helper should wrap the div in our notes.hbs that has the class “noteBlock”:
            </p>
            <pre class="language-markup"><code>
&lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-4&quot;&gt;
    {{#link-to 'note' note.id classNames=&quot;blockLink&quot;}}
    &lt;div class=&quot;noteBlock panel panel-default&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;panel-heading&quot;&gt;
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;panel-title blockLinkTitle&quot;&gt;
                {{note.title}}
                &lt;span&gt;
                    &lt;small class=&quot;muted blockLink&quot;&gt;
                    {{from-now-date note.created}}
                    &lt;/small&gt;
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;panel-body&quot;&gt;
            {{format-note-preview note.body}}
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    {{/link-to}}
&lt;/div&gt;
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                If you flip back over to your browser, you can see that the site is just plain broken. What happened here? 
                Open your browser’s dev tools (usually F12 on Windows), where you can see plainly what caused this problem:
            </p>
            <div class="screencap">
                <img class="img-responsive" src="images/error-no-route-named-note.png" alt="Error - 'note' route not found."/>
            </div>
            <p>
                Because the link-to helper is relying on the Ember resolver to locate where the anchor’s href tag 
                should be pointing, it has to know where to find the route itself, which it does by resolving 
                the name for the route that we provided in our link-to call. We haven’t created this route yet, 
                so Ember kindly provides an explanation so that we can correct the issue. Let’s fix it by 
                adding the route to our router.js in the Router.map() invocation:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
Router.map(function() {
   this.route('notes', { path: '/' });
   this.resource('note', { path: '/note/:note_id' });
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                And here, by modifying our route logic in app/routes/note.js to the following:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
export default Ember.Route.extend({
    model: function(params) {
        return this.store.find('note', params.note_id);
    } 
});
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                Now our notes should render correctly, and they now have anchors wrapped around them. 
                Click on the first one to see what happens.
            </p>
            <p>
                We see our note template rendered, but we’re only showing the title currently. 
                Let’s update that by changing the app/templates/note.hbs to look like this:
            </p>
            <pre class="language-markup"><code>
&lt;h1&gt;
    {{model.title}}
    &lt;button {{action &quot;removeNote&quot;}} class=&quot;destroy btn btn-danger&quot;&gt;Delete&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Written {{long-format-date model.created}}&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;pre&gt;{{model.body}}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                You’ll notice we’re referencing a new helper function for our date here. 
                This one is created by adding long-format-date.js to the app/helpers directory
                with the following logic:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Handlebars.makeBoundHelper(function(date) {
    return moment(date).format('MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm a');
});
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                This new helper just uses moment to give us a cleaner creation date.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now if you look at the note page, you can see all the details about this note. 
                Notice that the address of this page now points to the URL "note/1", where the 1 represents
                the id of the note we’re looking at. Did you notice where that came from? 
                When we added this route to the router.js, we added the “:note_id” parameter to
                the end. Ember recognizes that this will be a value passed in as part of the URL, 
                and makes it available to our note route code as a property of the params argument to the model function. 
                All you have to do is reference the params.note_id property to read out that value and use it in your route.
                This is another example of the "convention over configuration" approach taken in Ember making your job easier, 
                so you can focus less on plumbing and more on functionality.
            </p>

            <div class="page-header">
                <h3 id="Deleting">Deleting a Note</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                You’ll notice that we previously added a Delete button to the note details page. 
                Let's get that wired up so we can remove notes we no longer want stored on the server. 
                The note.hbs file shows that the delete button has an “action” property with a value of “removeNote” 
                assigned to the element in Handlebars syntax. The only thing we have to do to get the click event of this
                button to trigger the execution of code is to add the right action handler to the right controller.
                Since we're dealing with the note details page which is provided by the note route, the Note Controller 
                is where Ember will look for the action event handler. You <i>could</i> just create a note.js file under 
                the app/controllers directory, but let's keep using the CLI because it helps us ensure proper file placement
                and naming. Execute the following CLI command from the notesApp directory. We can shorten our command a bit
                as well, using the alis g for the generate command name.
            </p>
            <pre class="language-bash"><code>
ember g controller note
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                When the command finishes generating our note.js controller under the app/controllers directory, modify it 
                to implement our removeNote action being triggered by the delete button. 
            </p>
            <pre><code>
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Controller.extend({
    actions: {
        removeNote: function() {
            let self = this;
            let note = self.get('model');
            note.destroyRecord().then(function() {
                self.transitionToRoute('notes');
            });
        }
    }
});
            </code></pre>
            <div class="informational well">
                <h3>Just informational, don't actually write this code...</h3>
                <p>
                    This code demonstrates how events can be handled in Ember using the "actions" hash of a controller.
                    In Ember, the best way to handle events from the UI is to do what we've done here with the Delete button.
                    The element has an actions value specified in the view, and a function of the same name is implemented
                    in the controller's actions hash. Ember knows where to find the action because of this simple naming
                    convention, so we don't have to specify anything else to get the template communicating with the controller.
                    Ember allows us to specify the name of the event we want to watch for, but we didn't require it in this case
                    because 'click' is considered the default event for a button element. If we wanted to watch for another event, 
                    such as 'mouseover', we would have to provide that as an argument to the action helper in the template, like so:
                </p>
                <pre class="language-markup"><code>
&lt;button {{action &quot;removeNote&quot; note on=&quot;mouseover&quot;}} class=&quot;destroy btn btn-danger&quot;&gt;Delete&lt;/button&gt;
                </code></pre>
                <p>
                    Another example of the versatility of this built-in helper is the ability to pass arguments from the template 
                    directly to the action function on the controller. You aren't limited to passing simple primitive values either;
                    you can pass entire objects from the template to the action. In the code below, for example, we're passing a 
                    note by providing the instance from the template. All we would have to do on the controller side is add
                    an argument to the function so that we could access the note's data. Conventions for the win! 
                </p>
                <pre class="language-markup"><code>
&lt;button {{action &quot;removeNote&quot; note}} class=&quot;destroy btn btn-danger&quot;&gt;Delete&lt;/button&gt;
                </code></pre>
                <p>
                    One thing to be careful of in this helper is surrounding the correct arguments with quotes. Anything that
                    is being passed as an explicit value must be surrounded by quotes, including the name of the action being targeted.
                    However, any value being passed as a variable cannot be quoted at all. You can see this in the code block above,
                    where we wrap the name of the action we're targeting as well as the name of the event we want to watch for with
                    quotes, but the note that we're passing in isn't quoted because we're pointing to the variable in the template
                    that holds the data we want to provide. The text "action" isn't going to be quoted simply because it's the name
                    of the helper we're calling, and helpers do not have to be surrounded by quotes. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                The logic in the “removeNote” action is straightforward; it grabs the note from the controller using the 
                Ember standard get function, calls the destroyRecord() function on the note itself, and directs the user 
                back to the notes view once the removal completes. The destroyRecord() function is part of the Ember
                adapter API, and it tells the adapter that it should generate a delete request to the host that points to 
                the note we’ve removing. The generated call to our Web API in this case looks like:
            </p>
            <pre class="language-http"><code>
DELETE notes/1
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                Click the delete button once your browser has refreshed itself to see how this looks from the app.
            </p>

            <div class="page-header">
                <h3 id="CreateNewNote">Creating a New Note</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                Now we can view and delete notes, but once you've gone totally click-happy with the delete button,
                you're going to need to create new notes to refill your list. So, the next piece of functionality 
                we'll add is creating new notes to persist to the data store.
            </p>
            <p>
                We could do this by manually adding all of these files, or we can take advantage of the 
                Ember CLI generator commands. Let’s use the one below to do the boring work for us.
            </p>
            <pre class="language-bash"><code>
ember generate route new
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                You should see output telling you that the route was created under the routes folder, and the router.js 
                was updated automatically. Take a look at the files it says is modified/created to see what the 
                generator did for us. The CLI has the ability to nearly eliminate the chance of putting a file in the wrong
                place or naming it incorrectly, making it very unlikely that you'll ever have to sit there scratching your 
                head about why things just aren't working right after you added that last controller file. That type of
                problem has the potential to be rather frustrating to track down, so it's great that we can rely on these
                generator commands to ease the burden a bit, especially with an app that relies so heavily on accurate 
                naming conventions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that the files and route are there, we need a way to actually navigate to the new view in our app. 
                Modify the code in templates/notes.hbs by adding the following at the very top of the file above 
                all of the other markup:
            </p>
            <pre class="language-markup"><code>
&lt;div class=&quot;container addButtonDiv&quot;&gt;
    {{#link-to &quot;new&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-primary btn-sm&quot;}}Add Note{{/link-to}}
&lt;/div&gt;
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                Note that any text that comes in between the opening and closing "link-to" helper blocks will be used as the link text.
                Looking at your notes page now, you’ll see an Add Note button at the top. Click it to navigate to our new route. 
                Cool, but it’s empty. Replace the contents of the templates/new.hbs file with the following code:
            </p>
            <pre class="language-markup"><code>
&lt;h3&gt;Create a new note&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;input-group note-title&quot;&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Title&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    {{input type=&quot;text&quot;
            id=&quot;title&quot;
            value=model.note.title
            class=&quot;form-control&quot;
            placeholder=&quot;Title&quot;
    }}
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;input-group note-text&quot;&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Note&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    {{textarea class=&quot;form-control&quot; 
               cols=&quot;50&quot;
               rows=&quot;10&quot;
               id=&quot;note&quot;
               value=model.note.body
               placeholder=&quot;Enter your note here...&quot;
    }}
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;input-group&quot;&gt;
    &lt;label class=&quot;keyword-input&quot; for=&quot;keywords&quot;&gt;Keywords&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    {{input type=&quot;text&quot;
            id=&quot;keywords&quot;
            class=&quot;form-control&quot;
            value=model.note.keywords
            placeholder=&quot;Enter keywords&quot;
    }}
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;input-group&quot;&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;button&quot; {{action &quot;createNote&quot;}} 
           class=&quot;save btn btn-primary form-control&quot;
           value=&quot;Save&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                This page allows us to specify a title, body and keywords for our new note. 
                The interesting parts here are the new handlebars helpers for the inputs. 
                All these helpers do is allow us to specify what property of our underlying model the 
                element should be bound to, as well as giving us the opportunity to set some other 
                important attributes for the element (such as placeholder text, class, etc.) 
                If you look at the markup for the Save button, you can see that it’s referencing 
                an action called “createNote”. This means we need a “createNote” function in the 
                “actions” property of our controller. We haven’t created that yet, so let's generate it 
                now by running this from the notesApp directory:
            </p>
            <pre class="language-bash"><code>
ember g controller new
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                Let’s replace the contents of the newly generated route (at app/routes/new.js) with the code below. 
                This will tell the controller to grab a new, empty note from the store when we navigate to the new page.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({
    model: function() {
        return Ember.RSVP.hash({
            note: this.store.createRecord('note');
        });
    }    
});
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                The code above is utilizing the RSVP class in Ember to create a hash from an object with one property: note.
                The note property is being populated from our store, by calling the createRecord function with the name of
                the model as the sole argument. Remember that our store is just the abstraction we use in Ember to access data
                using the adapter instance we have setup in our project. In this case, the store is the Web API we're pulling the
                data from.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that the file new.js exists under app/controllers, we can replace its contents with the following, completing our createNote action logic:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Controller.extend({
    actions: {
        createNote: function() {
            let self = this;
            let note = self.get('model.note');
            note.save().then(function() {
                self.transitionToRoute('notes');
            });
        }
    } 
});
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                The code above grabs all of the data bound values from the new note page, retrieving all of the 
                input specified, then calls the save() function on the note. Once the save completes, the page is
                transitioned back to the notes page. One thing to note here: when you pull model data from an Ember 
                model, you have to use the get() function, passing in the property name as a string. Likewise, 
                when you set a property of an Ember model, you have to use the set() function, passing in the 
                property name as the first argument and the value to set it to as the second argument.
            </p>

            <div class="page-header">
                <h3 id="SortAndFilter">Sorting and Filtering</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                Hey, what the what? That newly created note came up at the top of the list but when I refreshed 
                the page manually, it moved all the way to the bottom. Now my latest notes are at the bottom 
                of the list. It doesn't seem that we're applying any logic to how our notes are displayed here. 
                This seems wrong, so let’s fix it.
            </p>
            <p>
                We’re currently taking the data we get back from the server and just iterating through it in 
                whatever order we get it back to render it to the list. We need to add a sorting function. 
                Thankfully, this is fairly easy in Ember. Since this is a middle-man type of job 
                (remember that controllers are good go-betweens for the view and the persisted data), 
                we’ll add some logic to the notes.js controller under app/controllers.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Controller.extend({
    filter: null,
    filteredNotes: Ember.computed('model.@each', function() {
        return this.get('model').sortBy('created').reverse();
    })    
});
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                We’ve added not only a filter property (which so far does absolutely nothing, don't worry...we'll get there), 
                but we’ve also created this filteredNotes property that takes all of the notes in the controller’s 
                model and orders them by created date in descending order. That’s really all it takes as far 
                as the logic goes. Let’s apply these changes to the notes.hbs template.
            </p>
            <p>
                Add this to the top of the template, next to the add button markup:
            </p>
            <pre class="language-markup"><code>
&lt;div class=&quot;container addButtonDiv&quot;&gt;
    {{input type=&quot;text&quot; placeholder=&quot;Keyword Filter&quot; value=filter}}
    {{#link-to 'new' class=&quot;btn btn-primary btn-sm&quot;}}Add Note{{/link-to}}
&lt;/div&gt;
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                ...and update the each binding to use our new filteredNotes property on the controller:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    {{#each filteredNotes as |note|}}
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-4&quot;&gt;
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                The filteredNotes property we added to the controller is created using the Ember.computed function, 
                which takes a string pointing to the model’s property that we’re binding to, and a function that 
                returns the actual data. The ‘@’ symbol in the first argument is a shortcut telling Ember we’re 
                applying this for each item in the collection. Ember’s computed function is used to tell Ember 
                we want to watch the property in question, and update the rendered output when something changes. 
                Let’s see how our changes have impacted the notes page by refreshing now.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hey, it’s all in the right order! Try filtering by keyword by typing something into the filter box. 
                Doesn’t work, does it? We added the filter property and the computed that updates our rendered 
                output based on changes to the collection, but we haven’t told the computed to update when the “filter” property
                changes as well. All we have to do to make that work is add the property name as an argument 
                to the computed function.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
filteredNotes: Ember.computed('model.@each', 'filter', function() {
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                Then add some logic to exclude non-matches with the filter property’s current value.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
filteredNotes: Ember.computed('model.@each', 'filter', function() {
    let filter = this.get('filter');
    return this.get('model').filter(note => {
        let keys = note.get('keywords');
        return !filter || 
            (keys &amp;&amp; keys.toLowerCase().indexOf(filter.toLowerCase()) !== -1);
    }).sortBy('created').reverse();    
});
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                That’s cool, now when we start to type a keyword into the filter textbox, only the matching notes will be visible. 
                The only issue here is that if there aren’t any matches, the screen is just empty. Let’s add a message to 
                inform the user that there aren’t any notes to display. Add the following to the notes.hbs template 
                right before the each call.
            </p>
            <pre class="language-markup"><code>
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    {{#unless filteredNotes}}
        &lt;h3&gt;No notes found.&lt;/h3&gt;
    {{/unless}}
    {{#each filteredNotes as |note|}}
    ...
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                Since we’re incorporating this keyword stuff, we might as well show the keywords on the note details screen. 
                Click one of the cards on the notes page so we can see how it looks while we’re working on it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let’s add the following code to the bottom of the note.hbs file under app/templates:
            </p>
            <pre class="language-markup"><code>
{{#each filteredKeywords as |keyword|}}
    &lt;span class=&quot;label label-primary label-as-badge&quot;&gt;
        {{keyword}}
    &lt;/span&gt;
{{/each}}
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                This will render a custom span for each of the keywords we have stored in the filteredKeywords 
                property of the model. Since this is view logic, this property will be setup on the note.js 
                controller under app/controllers as so:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
filteredKeywords: Ember.computed('model.@each', function() {
    let keys = this.get('model.keywords');
    return (keys ? keys.split(' ') : []);
})
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                When the page refreshes you’ll see each of the keywords assigned to that note below the body.
            </p>

                Ember and the interesting ways it utilizes conventions to make our jobs as developers easier.
                The following are some features you could add to the Notes App that will allow you to gain
                further experience working in Ember. Remember to create branches for each of these "experiments"
                so that you can have different versions of the app in the same repository, and can switch back
                and forth easily.

                Please note: the most useful portion of the Ember JS site is the Guides section, which you can access through the “Guides” menu link at the top of the
                page. Anything you could ever want to know is in there!
